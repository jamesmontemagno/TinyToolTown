Delta Board is a minimalist tool for running lightweight team retrospectives without the bloat of enterprise collaboration software.

**What it does:** Delta Board recreates the simplicity of sticky notes and a whiteboard for remote teams. It provides an anonymous space where team members can share what went well and what could be improved (the "delta"), then facilitates discussion without unnecessary features getting in the way.

**Why I built it:** After years of running retrospectives with my engineering team, I found that while the ritual itself is simple and valuable, the tools were often heavy, noisy, or overbuilt. I wanted something privacy-conscious and intentionally minimal that stays in the background and lets the conversation take center stage.

**Why it's delightful:** It respects the ritual. No user accounts, no bloat, just the essentials needed for honest team reflection. Anonymous contributions encourage genuine input, and the stripped-down interface means teams spend time thinking about their work rather than wrestling with the tool.
