.NET Virtual Environment, or `dotnet-venv` for short, is a .NET tool that installs the specified .NET SDK into the specified directory and pins the version using a `global.json` file.

If you are familiar with Python venv, `dotnet-venv` works similarly by creating an isolated environment with its own .NET SDK version.
