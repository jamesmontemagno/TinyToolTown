Kilowatt-hours are an amount, not a time.  Kilowatts are a rate, not an amount.  

Trying to multiply fractional kWh times N times a week at an energy rate that is in the tenths of cents was giving me a headache.

So I built this to help me keep track.  In the upcoming days and weeks I want to add in a bunch more related tools, but for right now it's here and does what it needs to.
