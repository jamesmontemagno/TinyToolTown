I built FancyGist because I love writing markdown and using GitHub Gists, but I wanted them to be... prettier. So this tool uses GitHub Gists as its backend! You can draft markdown gists in the platform itself, OR you can open any markdown gist in the platform by replacing gist.github.com with fancygist.com.

**Example:**

```
https://gist.github.com/cassidoo/18184cbcf524ad06057ec128602d61ca
```
becomes
```
https://fancygist.com/cassidoo/18184cbcf524ad06057ec128602d61ca
```
