FolderSnippets is a small Windows app that lives in the system tray and lets you paste saved snippets into any program with a couple of keystrokes. Press Ctrl+Alt+F to search a folder of .txt/.md snippets and press Enter to paste; the clipboard is restored after each paste. It supports selecting your snippets folder and can optionally start on Windows login, making repetitive text insertion fast and simple.
