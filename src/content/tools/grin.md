Grin can round trip .ini files into discrete, greppable assignments and back again. Inspired by gron (which does the same for JSON), grin lets you explore and filter .ini config files with standard *nix tools like grep, sed, and diff. It can also be useful in a PowerShell pipeline. I built it because INI files are everywhere but it was hard to search across sections while keeping context. It's delightful because it round-trips perfectly: pipe through grep, then grin --ungrin to get a valid .ini file back with just the parts you want.
