✨ Features

    📁 Task Groups: Organize your tasks into logical groups.
    📝 Task Details: Tasks have a title, optional description, completion status, and a priority (High/Medium/Low). A details panel shows each task's title, description, and priority.
    🔥 Priorities: Tasks have a priority with colors and symbols (High=Red !, Medium=Yellow •, Low=Green ○) and can be cycled with p.
    🔀 Sorting & Reordering: Tasks can be sorted by Title, Status, or Creation Date and the sort order can be toggled. Use s to cycle sort mode and r to toggle ascending/descending. Use ↑/↓ to move tasks up/down within a group.
    🖱️ Mouse Support: Click groups or tasks to select them and use the mouse wheel to scroll the selection.
    💾 Persistence & Performance: Saves data in the standard user data directory using atomic writes and buffered I/O for integrity and speed.
    🎨 TUI: Built with ratatui and crossterm.
