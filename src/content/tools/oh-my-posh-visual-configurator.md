Oh My Posh Visual Configurator is a modern web app for designing Oh My Posh terminal prompts visually instead of hand-editing JSON. You can browse 103+ segments, drag and drop them into your prompt, tweak colors/templates/alignments, and see a live preview instantly. Export your config as JSON, YAML, or TOML and share themes with the community. It’s delightful because it’s 100% client-side with auto-save, smart defaults, and built-in segment documentation.
