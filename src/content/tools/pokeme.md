You're running 5, 10, maybe 15 coding agents simultaneously, and they all have questions. Needy, blocky, "I can't continue without you" questions. Your terminal tabs are multiplying like gremlins. You're alt-tabbing so fast your keyboard is smoking. Poke Me is about centralizing all that neediness into one place
