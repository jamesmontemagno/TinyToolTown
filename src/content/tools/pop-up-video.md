I was feeling nostalgic for “the old days” and wanted an endless stream of music videos with fun facts over them. This does a good job at the similar feel of the original. It requires the Tamper Monkey Browser Plug-in and a Python server running on localhost. I chose GitHub for a caching CDN for a couple of songs as examples.
