README Badge Creator is an all-in-one web tool that generates professional README badges — including one-click install badges for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers across multiple IDEs. It also creates VS Code Marketplace badges, package badges (NPM, NuGet, PyPI, etc.), and customizable GitHub repo badges (stars, workflows, contributors, and more). It’s delightful because it has a live preview, one-click copy to clipboard, and can export a complete “Getting Started” README section with install instructions and CLI commands.
