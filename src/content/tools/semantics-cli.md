Stop treating audio and video like unsearchable blobs.
​Finding context in a recording shouldn't be a game of "play, scrub, and hope you find it."

​The concept is simple: you give the CLI raw video or audio files, and it extracts everything into structured, queryable data. It’s not just processing; it’s extracting meaning you can actually use.
​Suddenly, your media library becomes as accessible as your notes. You can find moments, topics, people, objects, and specific context without ever touching a timeline.
​Because the output is structured, it's also ready for an AI agent to reason over and act upon.

Your footage stops being "lost footage" and starts being data.

​Stop digging. Start extracting.
