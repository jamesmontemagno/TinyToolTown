I'm not the original creator, original work [mtoyoda/sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl).

It draws a "steam locomotive" (sl) across the screen when you accidentally type `sl` instead of `ls`.

A friend showed it to me, and I oddly became obsessed. Added train cars. Ported it to windows, translated to rust, zig, back to rust. Building in WASM to have a web version that my son now demands I show him whenever he sees my phone (he's 2 and loves trains), vibe coded offline support for toddler emergencies.
