Created a neat, load balancer-like CLI tool to help researchers, students, and everyone curious to explore AI CLI tools in a neat way. TJ (Terminal Jarvis) acts like your central command to then go download/update/learn/use/explore tools like: Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Crush, Llxprt, etc.

Best to leverage in a remote development enviornment like GitHub Codespaces, Coder, or DevPod.sh
