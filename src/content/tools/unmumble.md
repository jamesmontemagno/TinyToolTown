Using Claude Code made me way too tolerant of my own goofy typos — the agent just understands what I mean. But the people I talk to every day deserve better. Unmumble is a simple Raycast script command that fixes typos, spelling errors, and jumbled words without changing meaning, capitalization, or punctuation. Select text, hit a hotkey, and it comes back clean in about 1-2 seconds. Uses Claude 3 Haiku via OpenRouter (fractions of a penny per fix) or swap in any model including local ones via Ollama. It's delightful because it turns "i jsut wanted to chekc in abuot the meeitng tomrrow" into proper English instantly, in any app on your Mac.
